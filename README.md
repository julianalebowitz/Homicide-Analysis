# Homicide Analysis

This project was done in R Markdown using data from the Murder Accountability Project, which records all U.S. homicides from 1980 to 2014. It seeks to visualize and analyze relationships between homicide solve status (solved vs unsolved) and other categorical factors such as Police Precinct, Victim Race, Victim Age, Weapon, etc. The ultimate goal is to identify inequalities in solve rates and find areas for improvement.
