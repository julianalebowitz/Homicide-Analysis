# homicide-analysis

This project was done using data from the Murder Accountability Project, which records all U.S. homicides from 1980 to 2014. It seeks to analyze relationships between homicide solve rates and categorical factors such as Police Precinct, Victim Race, Victim Age, Weapon, etc. The goal is to identify inequalities and other areas for improvement.
